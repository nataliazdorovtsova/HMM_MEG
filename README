This is the script repository for 'The entropy of resting-state neural dynamics is a marker of general cognitive ability in childhood' (Zdorovtsova et al., 2023). 

HMM_MEG has several dependencies, and while most of the scripts rely on MATLAB, we chose do do Maxfiltering in Python. You will need:
-SPM 12
-The OSL repository (https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl/) and more specifically, the HMM-MAR toolbox (https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR)
-HCP Workbench (for visualisation; see https://humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench)

The order in which you do MEG data preprocessing is important. We did things in this order, with these scripts and programs:

1. Maxfiltering and ICA artefact removal (see Python script 'HMM_MaxfilterAndICA.py').
2. Conversion into .mat and .dat files (SPM 12)
3. Bandpass filtering between 1Hz and 30Hz (SPM 12)
4. Coregistration to T1 scans (SPM 12)
5. Beamforming (see Matlab script 'HMM_Beamforming.m').
6. Parcellation (see Matlab script 'HMM_ApplyParcellation_38.m').
7. Other preprocessing - including detrending, channel standardisation, leakage correction, application of a Hilbert envelope, and downsampling (see Matlab script 'HMM_FinishPreprocessing.m').

You can look for bad segments in your timeseries data (and exclude participants as necessary) using 'HMM_BadSegments.m'.

HMM computation is done within the matlab script 'HMM_Compute.m'. 

Calculate other useful features, plus generate some preliminary plots, using 'HMM_Info.m'). 

Compare intervals, lifetimes, and fractional occupancies between states using 'HMM_BetweenStatesAnalyses.m'.

Assess relationships between behaviour, cognition, and state measures using 'HMM_CognitiveBehaviouralAnalyses.m'.

Compute entropy rates, modularity, and communicability across state transition matrices using 'HMM_Entropy.m'. While we did not include any modularity or communicability calculations in the
current paper, we did see a few interesting effects, and you might also be interested in looking into these relationships in your analyses. In a past paper of ours 
(Zdorovtsova et al., 2023: 10.1016/j.cortex.2023.04.001), we found that nodal communicability is related to cognitive ability in a sample of children with developmental difficulties.

Finally, you can visualise HMM states in HCP Workbench using 'HMM_visualise.m'
